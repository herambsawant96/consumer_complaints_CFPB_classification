# consumer complaints CFPB classification
LSTM model for classifiying coinsumer complaints

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a federal U.S. agency that acts as a mediator when disputes arise between financial institutions and consumers. Via a web form, consumers can send the agency a narrative of their dispute. The CFPB writes and enforces rules for financial institutions, examines both bank and non-bank financial institutions, monitors and reports on markets, as well as collects and tracks consumer complaints.
<br><br>
This project provides a LSTM model which is capable of classifying complaints with <b>87% accuracy</b>. This makes the classification of complaints and their routing to the appropriate teams more efficient than manually tagged complaints.
