# consumer complaints CFPB classification
LSTM model for classifiying coinsumer complaints

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a federal U.S. agency that acts as a mediator when disputes arise between financial institutions and consumers. Via a web form, consumers can send the agency a narrative of their dispute. The project provides a LSTM model which is capable of classifying complaints with 87% accuracy. This makes the classification of complaints and their routing to the appropriate teams more efficient than manually tagged complaints.
